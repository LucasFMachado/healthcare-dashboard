## Technical choices:

**- Project creation:**
  
  I created the project using create next-app (https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app). The Next version used was 13, and the project uses the new concepts and features of this version.


**- Architecture**

  I divided the project in a way that it could be scalable. I preferred to create the components and the style in the same file, so that later maintenance would be easier.


**- Styles:**

  For the styling of the project, I used the **styled-components** library. I really like using this library because I think it keeps the code organized, and makes it much easier to style using cascade.


**- Code styling:**

  For pattern of project's code, I used the eslint and prettier libraries, so that coding rules and patterns could be implemented.


## Main technologies used in the project:

* [NextJS](https://nextjs.org)
* [TypesCript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
* [Styled-Components](https://styled-components.com)
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
* [Apexcharts](https://apexcharts.com)
